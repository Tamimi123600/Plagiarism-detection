    "Recall that the goal of this project is to build a plagiarism classifier. At it's heart, this task is a comparison text; one that looks at a given answer and a source text, compares them and predicts whether an answer has plagiarized from the source. To effectively do this comparison, and train a classifier we'll need to do a few more things: pre-process all of the text data and prepare the text files (in this case, the 95 answer files and 5 original source files) to be easily compared, and split the data into a `train` and `test` set that can be used to train a classifier and evaluate it, respectively.

Since plagiarism is a fairly complex task with varying levels, it's often useful to include other measures of similarity. Another useful feature called **longest common subsequence**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> The longest common subsequence is the longest string of words (or letters) that are *the same* between the Wikipedia Source Text (S) and the Student Answer Text (A). This value is also normalized by dividing by the total number of words (or letters) in the  Student Answer Text. \n",

    "\n",
    "It may be helpful to think of this in a concrete example. A Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem may look as follows:\n",
    "* Given two texts: text A (answer text) of length n, and string S (original source text) of length m. The goal is to produce their longest common subsequence of words: the longest sequence of words that appear left-to-right in both texts (though the words don't have to be in continuous order).\n",
    "* Consider:\n",
    "    * A = \"i think pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by google that uses a system of weights attached to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents\"\n",
    "    * S = \"pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by the google internet search engine that assigns a numerical weighting to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this case, we can see that the start of each sentence of fairly similar, having overlap in the sequence of words, \"pagerank is a link analysis algorithm used by\" before diverging slightly. Then we **continue moving left -to-right along both texts** until we see the next common sequence; in this case it is only one word, \"google\". Next we find \"that\" and \"a\" and finally the same ending \"to each element of a hyperlinked set of documents\".\n",

    "* If I count up each word that I found in common I get the value 20. **So, LCS has length 20**. \n",
    "* Next, to normalize this value, divide by the total length of the student answer; in this example that length is only 27. **So, the function `lcs_norm_word` should return the value `20/27` or about `0.7408`.**\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "One thing to notice here is that, can efficiently fill up this matrix one cell at a time. Each grid cell only depends on the values in the grid cells that are directly on top and to the left of it, or on the diagonal/top-left. The rules are as follows:\n",
    "* Start with a matrix that has one extra row and column of zeros.\n",
    "* By traversing the string:\n",
    "    * If there is a match, fill that grid cell with the value to the top-left of that cell *plus* one. So, when  found a matching B-B, added +1 to the value in the top-left of the matching cell, 0.\n",
    "    * If there is not a match, will take the *maximum* value from either directly to the left or the top cell, and carry that value over to the non-match cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='notebook_ims/matrix_rules.png' width=50% />\n",

    "After completely filling the matrix, **the bottom-right cell will hold the non-normalized LCS value**.\n",
